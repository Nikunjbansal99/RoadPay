### Minor 2 Project

# System Requirements
● Eclipse IDE<br>
● Operating System: Windows/Linux<br>
● Memory: 4GB RAM<br>
● Processor: Intel Pentium or compatible, 1.6 GHz minimum(2GHz+ recommended)<br>
● 1024*768 or higher-resolution monitor<br>
● Mouse or another pointing device<br>
● Hard Drive: 4-50 GB of free space<br>

# Objectives
● Create a dynamic Web-App to show functionalities of a modern wallet made for automated road taxation.<br>
● To collect and store data records of users including personal and vehicle information and toll tax transactions history to be reviewed by the required authorities.<br>
● To make a user-friendly interface so that all users can easily traverse through the website.<br>
● Build a robust backend to calculate and deduct allotted amounts, based on their details (occupation, vehicle type, toll Tax Exemption List), from users' online wallets.<br>
● Create a well-documented and easily interpretable code for other developers to understand.<br>

# Technologies Used
● Apache Tomcat Server 8.5<br>
● SQL Plus<br>
● JSP<br>

</p>
● The methodology which we used is Agile Development. <br>
● This method is an iterative and incremental method in which the complete development of the application will be divided into sub tasks and each task will be considered as a small project in itself, i.e. fulfilling the objectives.<br>
